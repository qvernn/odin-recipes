# odin-recipes
Recipes project for The Odin Project

In this project, I was able to showcase my ability to create a simple website that features food that I enjoy.

I employed my knowledge on boilerplates, typing the boilerplate for each and every html file included in the project to gain familiarity with the usual things that need to be included.

For constructing the landing page and the recipe pages, I was utilizing the different headers, making both ordered and unordered lists, anchoring one webpage to another, and placing images within webpages.

Aside from those, I've now given more thought on making good commit messages to ensure that it is easy to track the different changes done to a project. I can see more clearly as to how writing better commit messages would result to better collaboration.
