                <li class="odd">1 English cucumber, cut into matchsticks</li>
                <li>1/4 cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste) (Optional)</li>
                <li class="odd">1 bunch fresh spinach, cut into thin strips</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li class="odd">1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
                <li>2 carrots, cut into matchsticks</li>
                <li class="odd">1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
                <li class="odd">1 pound thinly-sliced beef top round steak</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
                <li class="odd">4 large eggs</li>
                <li>4 cups cooked white rice</li>
                <li class="odd">4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, divided</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
                <li class="odd">2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), divided (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir cucumber pieces with 1/4 cup gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>Bring about 2 cups of water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until spinach is bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside in a bowl and stir soy sauce into spinach.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in large nonstick skillet and cook and stir carrots until softened, about 3 minutes; stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 more minute. Stir in cucumber pieces with gochujang paste; sprinkle with red pepper flakes, and set the mixture aside in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side, and set aside. In a separate nonstick skillet, heat 1 more teaspoon olive oil over medium-low heat and fry the eggs just on one side until yolks are runny but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes each.</li>
                <li>To assemble the dish, divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.</li>
            </ol>
